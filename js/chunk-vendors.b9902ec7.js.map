It is packed into a\n * special CubeUV format that allows us to perform custom interpolation so that\n * we can support nonlinear formats such as RGBE. Unlike a traditional mipmap\n * chain, it only goes down to the LOD_MIN level (above), and then creates extra\n * even more filtered 'mips' at the same LOD_MIN resolution, associated with\n * higher roughness levels. In this way we maintain resolution to smoothly\n * interpolate diffuse lighting while limiting sampling computation.\n *\n * Paper: Fast, Accurate Image-Based Lighting\n * https://drive.google.com/file/d/15y8r_UpKlU9SvV4ILb0C3qCPecS8pvLz/view\n*/\n\nclass PMREMGenerator {\n\n\tconstructor( renderer ) {\n\n\t\tthis._renderer = renderer;\n\t\tthis._pingPongRenderTarget = null;\n\n\t\tthis._lodMax = 0;\n\t\tthis._cubeSize = 0;\n\t\tthis._lodPlanes = [];\n\t\tthis._sizeLods = [];\n\t\tthis._sigmas = [];\n\n\t\tthis._blurMaterial = null;\n\t\tthis._cubemapMaterial = null;\n\t\tthis._equirectMaterial = null;\n\n\t\tthis._compileMaterial( this._blurMaterial );\n\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Generates a PMREM from a supplied Scene, which can be faster than using an\n\t * image if networking bandwidth is low.
